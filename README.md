# Pinpoints-of-immigration

Comming from a family of immigrants, I find it intersting the different points of view that people have against
these families. They quickly generalize the issue towards one race without substantial evidence while disregarding
that they too were from immigrant families as well. 

I wanted to analyze all types of immigration data from how many of each race immigrate into the United States, 
how the pandemic has affected the travel across the border, the purpose of these fmailies and how many of them 
make it to the other side permantly.
