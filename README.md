# Pinpoints-of-immigration

Statistics on Immigration into the United States. There have been many political and social contraversies surrounding this phenomena and
wanted to represnt the numbers to see the roots of it. 


## Motivation
Comming from a family of immigrants, I find it intersting the different points of view that people have against
these families. They quickly generalize the issue towards one race without substantial evidence while disregarding
that they too were from immigrant families as well. 

I wanted to analyze all types of immigration data from how many of each race immigrate into the United States, 
how the pandemic has affected the travel across the border, the purpose of these fmailies and how many of them 
make it to the other side permantly.
