# Understanding Immigration 

Statistics on Immigration into the United States. There have been many political and social contraversies surrounding this phenomena and
wanted to represent the numbers to see the roots of it. Overall, I want people to understand the reasons behind immigration, specifically illegal immigration 
to limit the number of generalizations of negative viewpoints to immigration. 


## Motivation
Comming from a family of immigrants, I find it intersting the different points of view that people have against these families. They quickly generalize the issue towards one race without substantial evidence while disregarding that they too were from immigrant families as well. I do not want to sugarcoat the topic rather open a new light to those who are not open minded of these issues that do not have to be entirly political. 

I wanted to analyze all types of immigration data from how many of each race immigrate into the United States, 
what the purpose of these fmailies and how many of them make it to the other side permantly. I mostly want to compare the negative or disagreement points of view of immigration with datasets on how many and why these people come here.
