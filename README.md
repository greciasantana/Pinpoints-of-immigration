# Understanding Immigration 

Statistics on Immigration into the United States. Immigration is a huge political phenomena to the United States residents; mostly because of generalization. They mostly tackle on the illigal side of immigration arguing that it is unlawful--which it is no rebuttle there-- but struggle to comprehend the 'why' as well the type of people behind illigal immigration. It is not just adults coming into the United States. There are also children and teens coming alone or with distant family. The general incentive to come into the United States is to start over with a clean slate; to have a better life in the 'Land of Opportunity'. To immigrate one has to go through the legal process and paperwork which takes a long time and money. As a result, there is a substantial amount of people that just skip that step and immigrate illegally.

## Motivation
Comming from a family of immigrants, I find it intersting the different points of view that people have against these families. They quickly generalize the issue towards one race without substantial evidence while disregarding that they too were from immigrant families as well. I do not want to sugarcoat the topic rather open a new light to those who are not open minded of these issues that do not have to be entirly political. 

I wanted to analyze all types of immigration data from how many of each race immigrate into the United States, 
what the purpose of these fmailies and how many of them make it to the other side permantly. I mostly want to compare the negative or disagreement points of view of immigration with datasets on how many and why these people come here. 

### Big Question(s)
At what age is it optimal for immigrants to come into the United States illegally?

Supplemental questions: 
 - Why do people immigrate illegally?

## Reasons of Immigration

I did some external research to get an accurate general idea of why people leave their country of birth and immigrate to the United States. The article [The Most Common Reasons Why People Immigrate to US] (https://sandiegoimmigrationlawcenter.com/the-most-common-reasons-why-people-immigrate-to-us/ "The Most Common Reasons Why People Immigrate to US) gives broad reasons and elaborates them.
